    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
        Professionally, my passion for technology intersects with online learning🌐. As a project manager at a company specializing in e-learning, I lead projects that apply technological standards like LTI 1.3 to enhance the educational experience.

        On a not-so-professional level, I'm passionate about motorcycles🏍️, kettlebells💪, e-learning🖥️ and veganism🌱.
