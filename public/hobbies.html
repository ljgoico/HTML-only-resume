    <h2>Motorcycles🏍️</h2>
    <p><strong>Spoiler alert❗️</strong></p>
    <p>This is a sad story 🥺</p>
    <p>I absolutely loved riding my motorcycle, but someone took it from my parking lot during the night.</p>

    <h2>Kettlebells💪</h2>
    <p>I've been training at home for over 2 years now. Mainly using kettlebells. Best part is I've become much stronger and fit than before, I don't have to wait to use a weight and I can train in my pijamas!</p>

    <h2>Veganism🌱</h2>
    <p>I've been vegan for 10 years and it's something I'm really into. I love reading books about it. Although it's been 10 years, there's still so many things one can learn. Also, best part is I'm still waiting to faint from the lack of protein.</p>
